With electronic claim submission, tracking claims become easier, corrections can be made instantaneously and there won’t be any lag in receiving carrier confirmation reports, all of which will go a long way in avoiding costly rejection.

<br><br>
<b>Payment Posting</b><br>

<b>Denial Management</b><br>

We understand that data plays a crucial role in plugging the torrent of unpaid claims. Hence we have made data analysis an integral part of our denial management services and ensure that every claim that is being denied by your payers is thoroughly scrutinized. Leveraging this level of intelligence, our denial management specialists can easily spot and fix the issues that are leading to the denials (whether it be issues with the claims or issues with the payers) and stop the stream of unpaid claims into your hospital revenue cycle. Once we do this, you can expect an inflow of additional 20% to 30% of revenues into your healthcare practice.

           <h3 class="mb-3">INSURANCE & ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION</h3>
            <p>According to industry sources, 75% of all claim denials are because a patient is not eligible for services billed to the insurer by the provider. Often, a patient would be ineligible for benefits because his or her policy has been terminated or modified. </p>
            <P>ARMFOX can help practices dramatically reduce their accounts receivable cycle and increase revenue, by significantly reducing the impact of ineligibility, and increasing the number of "clean" claims that are sent to insurers (i.e., claims that are both complete, and are only for patients who are eligible for benefits). Unfortunately, eligibility verification is one of the most neglected elements in the revenue cycle. </P>
            <P>In the absence of proper eligibility and benefits verification countless downstream problems are created; delayed payments, rework, decreased patient satisfaction, increased errors, and nonpayment. To avoid these problems, ARMFOX provides a remotely hosted Centralized Eligibility Unit for Hospitals and Faculty Practice Plans. The solution consists of ARMFOX deploying staff, technology, management and expertise with the objective of delivering high-quality cost-effective patient insurance eligibility and related services. </P>
            <h5>ARMFOX Eligibility Verification Services has the potential to: </h5>
<ul>
           <li><p>Improve Account Receivable Cycles (reduce Account Receivable Days) </p></li>

           <li><p>Increased number of clean claims </p></li>
           <li><p>Increase cash collections by reducing write-offs and denials </p></li></ul>
           <H5>Our Insurance Eligibility & Benefits Verification Services Include: </H5>

            <ul><li><p>Receive Schedules from the Hospital via EDI, email or fax </p></li>

          <li> <p> Verify coverage on all Primary and Secondary (if applicable) Payers by utilizing sites like WebMD, Payer Web Sites, Automated Voice </p></li>

          <li><p>Responses and phone calls to Payers </p></li>

        <li> <p>Contact patient for information if necessary </p></li>

         <li> <p>Provide the client with the results which include eligibility and benefits information such as member ID, group ID, coverage end and start dates, copay information and much more. </p></li></ul>

          <h5>Related Services (optional): </h5>
<ul>
            <li><p>

            </p></li>

           <li> <p>Medicaid Enrollment </p></li></ul>
            <p>Eligibility verification defines who can render what care and under what circumstances. As such, ensuring that patients are eligible for services before care is rendered reduces rework of claims and alerts providers and patients to their options. </p>

            <h4>SKILLSETS </h4><p>Our coders are proficient with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

            <p>CPT, ICD-10, and HCPCS coding across various specialties </p></li>

            <li><P>Payer-specific coding requirements </P></li>
            <li><P>Software like ENCODERPRO and CODERITE </P></li></ul>

            <h4>CODING THE TRANSCRIBED REPORTS </h4><p>The coding process begins when an operative report or charge sheet is batched and arrives on the desk of a coder. His job is to extract information from this Physician’s report on the charge sheet and code it according to specified guidelines </p>

            <h4>PROCEDURAL AND DIAGNOSTIC CODING </h4>

            <p>ARMFOX’s certified medical coders handle Procedural and Diagnostic Coding using references such as ICD-10-CM, LMRP, CPT Assistant, and HCPCS Level II. Here’s what happens: </p>
            <ul>
            <li><P>After a patient visits a physician, a chart is prepared and given to Medical Coders, whose job is to: </P></li>
            <li><P>Read the chart </P></li>
            <li><P>Match the problem with its corresponding numerical code from the most current ICD-10 (International Classifications of Diseases) Book </P></li>
            <li><P>Assign the proper diagnosis code with its numerical code from the CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) Book </P></li>

            <p>These two codes (Procedural and Diagnostic codes) and any modifier codes that may be needed to better describe the medical problem and its treatment are placed on a patient encounter form or super bill. The patient’s chart is then re-filed and the encounter form/super bill is given to a medical billing team.</p>
            <p>For billing purposes, the use of the ICD codes, when juxtaposed with CPT codes, tells the payer </p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>What service has been provided </p></li>
            <li><p>Lists the diagnosis, symptom, complaint, condition or problem (e.g., the reason for performing the service). </p></li></ul>
            <p>This information is essential for accurate, timely and optimized third-party reimbursement. </p>
            <h4>QUALITY CHECKS </h4>
